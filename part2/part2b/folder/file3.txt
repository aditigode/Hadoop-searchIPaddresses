he Bonus Jonas was feeling a little extra this Halloween!

Frankie Jonas, the 22-year-old younger brother of the Jonas Brothers' Joe, Kevin and Nick, poked fun at Joe with a callback to his past relationship with ex, Taylor Swift, as he and girlfriend Anna Olson went out on Halloween dressed as Swift, 32, and Joe, 33, as they appeared in 2009's Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience.

Mocking his older brother, Frankie wore a tight "Burnin' Up" t-shirt, a black vest, and styled his hair directly in front of his face, as he fake-sang to Olson, who wore a sequin dress similar to the one Swift wore when she performed with Joe back in the day.
