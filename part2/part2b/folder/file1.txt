Taylor Swift scores one of the most historic weeks in the 64-year history of the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart, as she becomes the first artist to claim the survey’s entire top 10 in a single frame.

Swift surpasses Drake, who logged nine of the Hot 100’s top 10 for a week in September 2021.

Leading the way for Swift on the Hot 100, “Anti-Hero” launches at No. 1, marking her ninth career leader.

All 10 songs in the Hot 100’s top tier are from Swift’s new LP Midnights, which, released Oct. 21 on Republic Records, blasts in at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart with the biggest week for any release in seven years.
